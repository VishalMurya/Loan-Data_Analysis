# LOAN APPROVAL (Data Analysis)
## About Project
I Have made This loan_Appproval Prediction Model using Linear, Decission Trees . The main objectives of this case study are as follows:

* To apply data preprocessing and preparation techniques in order to obtain clean data (EDA).
* It Figures out The different methods and picked the best ones to guess if people will pay back loans .
* To build machine learning models able to predict Loan_status based on certain criteria.
* To analyze and compare models performance in order to choose the best model.and Hopefully.It Has 95% Accuracy_score
